# CodingProblems
Just a collection of coding exercises for practice

Currently I am uploading problem solutions in Python. 
I am still learning Python and the uploads are essentially how I solved the problem writing in C++.
Hence it is not optimized to be pythonic in its implementation. At this point the plan is to get 
comfortable with Python. 

The examples are just a way to practicing Python.
